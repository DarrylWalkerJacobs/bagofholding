# Bag Of Holding

A magical grab bag of useful tools for the discerning developer.

This project's github pages and local demo were bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Demos & Examples

The interactive demos for Reducks leverage `react`, `react-redux` and the wonderful libraries `rsup-progress` and `react-toastr` to demonstrate the FIFO queuing system in action.

If you are integrating Reducks into a `react-redux` application I recommend browsing the source code of the demo pages.
